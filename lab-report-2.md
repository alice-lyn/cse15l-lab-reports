## Part 3
- Pretty much everything we learned in labs in week 2 and 3 is new to me. I learned how to log in to a connect to a server from a remote computer, and how to build and create a server by implementing URLHandler interface. I also learned how to set up SSH keys so that I don't have to type the password out every time when I need to frequently log in to a remote account. Moreover, I learned about some important commands such as 'ssh', 'curl', 'mkdir', 'scp', and so on.
